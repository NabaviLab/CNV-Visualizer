Welcome to CNVisualizer's documentation!
========================================

CNVisualizer is an extension of the HTML-5 version of the `Integrated Genome
Viewer`_, forked off of `igv.js`_.

It extends the project by improving the implementation of segmented CNV
tracks as well as adding an implementation for raw CNV read values. It also
packages the product in an electron app as an example of using the library
that was created.
